# Pascal's Triangle

Pascal's Triangle is a triangular array of numbers where each number is the sum of the two numbers directly above it. It is named after the French mathematician Blaise Pascal.

## Algorithm

To generate Pascal's Triangle, we can use the following algorithm:

1. Start with the first row containing only the number 1.
2. For each subsequent row, add a 1 at the beginning and end of the row.
3. For each number in the row (except the first and last), calculate the sum of the two numbers directly above it in the previous row.
4. Repeat steps 2 and 3 until the desired number of rows is reached.

## Example

Here is an example of Pascal's Triangle with 5 rows:
