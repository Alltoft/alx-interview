# Lockboxes

This folder contains the solutions for the "Lockboxes" problem in the ALX Interview preparation curriculum.

## Problem Description

The "Lockboxes" problem involves a set of lockboxes, each containing keys to other lockboxes. The goal is to determine if all the lockboxes can be opened by sequentially using the keys found in each box.

## Files

- `main.py`: Contains the implementation of the lockbox opening algorithm.
- `test_main.py`: Contains unit tests for the lockbox opening algorithm.

## Usage

To use the lockbox opening algorithm, follow these steps:

1. Import the `open_lockboxes` function from `main.py`.
2. Create a list of lockboxes, where each lockbox is represented as a list of keys.
3. Call the `open_lockboxes` function with the list of lockboxes as the argument.
4. The function will return `True` if all the lockboxes can be opened, and `False` otherwise.
