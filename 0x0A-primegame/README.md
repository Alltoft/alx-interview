# Prime Game

## Description

This is a program that allows players to play the Prime Game. The Prime Game is a two-player game where each player takes turns selecting a number from a given range. The goal of the game is to select prime numbers, and the player with the highest sum of prime numbers at the end of the game wins.

## Rules

1. The game is played with a range of numbers from `start` to `end`, inclusive.
2. Players take turns selecting a number from the range.
3. The selected number must be a prime number.
4. Once a number is selected, it cannot be selected again.
5. The game ends when all prime numbers in the range have been selected.
6. The player with the highest sum of prime numbers wins the game.

## Usage

To play the Prime Game, follow these steps:

1. Enter the range of numbers you want to play with (e.g., `start = 1`, `end = 100`).
2. Player 1 selects a prime number from the range.
3. Player 2 selects a prime number from the remaining range.
4. Repeat steps 2 and 3 until all prime numbers have been selected.
5. Calculate the sum of prime numbers selected by each player.
6. Determine the winner based on the highest sum of prime numbers.

## Example

Let's play a game with the range `start = 1` and `end = 10`:

1. Player 1 selects `2` (the only prime number in the range).
2. Player 2 selects `3` (the only remaining prime number in the range).
3. Player 1 wins with a sum of `2`.
